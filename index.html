                <h2>Space</h2>
                <p>Space is the name given to the rest of the universe outside the atmosphere 
                    of the world. The average temperature is -270 degrees centigrade. 
                    There is no definite boundary between the atmosphere and space, 
                    but the Earth's atmosphere is thinner as it goes upwards. 
                    There are probably millions of galaxies in space. 
                    In these estimated galaxies there are estimated millions of systems, 
                    planets and astroids. The first solid information on space was taken 
                    from observatories established in the northern countries especially in
                    the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Palamar Observatory in the
                    US state of California is the largest of the world's observatories. 
                    The diameter of the mirrored telescope is 5 meters in height and 40 meters
                    in height. The intensity of the bulk of the sky in the observers at the 
                    observers, etc. Are examined. The first person in space was Yuri Gagarin,
                    who was sent to the USSR by the USSR on 12 April 1961. In the meantime, 
                    thousands of satellite orbits have been placed or launched into space to 
                    provide space for communication on earth to allow people to settle in space.</p>
